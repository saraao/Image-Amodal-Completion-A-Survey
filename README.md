# Image-Amodal-Completion-A-Survey

This repository categorises computer vision research papers about single image-based amodal completion techniques according to their target task. The classification is based on our survey: ["Image Amodal Completion: A Survey"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02062). By leveraging our repository and survey, researchers and practitioners alike can gain a comprehensive insight into the latest developments in image amodal completion and make informed decisions about which techniques/datasets to apply in their own work.


> SURVEY ABSTRACT: Existing computer vision systems can compete with humans in understanding the visible parts of objects, but still fall far short of humans when it comes to depicting the invisible parts of partially occluded objects. Image amodal completion aims to equip computers with human-like amodal completion functions to understand an intact object despite it being partially occluded. The main purpose of this survey is to provide an intuitive understanding of the research hotspots, key technologies and future trends in the field of image amodal completion. Firstly, we present a comprehensive review of the latest literature in this emerging field, exploring three key tasks in image amodal completion, including amodal shape completion, amodal appearance completion, and order perception. Then we examine popular datasets related to image amodal completion along with their common data collection methods and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss real-world applications and future research directions for image amodal completion, facilitating the reader's understanding of the challenges of existing technologies and upcoming research trends.
